# Goals
Thie goals described here are in some kind similar
to a milestone plan but without concrete dates.

1. ESP connects to WiFi, greps the time of a time
server and forwards that time to a local IP address.
    - WiFi connection established
    - Connection to time server established
    - Time forwarded to a local website

2. Create a concept to transform the time
to a virtual LED-Matrix.
    - Figured out which time intervals correspond
    to which activated LED's
    - Made a plan for driving the LED's 
    for example registers, serial interface or 
    equivalent
    - Created a SW-architecture for the final clock.

3. Hardware implementation and testing.
    - Ordered all relevant components
    - Tested digital chips
    - Soldered all LED's together
    - Tested and validated the basic functionality
    of the clock

4. Clock Design.
   - Determined which material to use and the size of the clock
   - Cut out the according front plate
   - Placed all components into the housing

5. Test and (hopefully) enjoy your fully functional word clock.
